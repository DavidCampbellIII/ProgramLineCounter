# Program Line Counter
Counts all the meaningful (or meaningless) lines in your code given a root directory.

### Current Features
- Select root file directory where you'd like the count to start
- Provide the file extension for the files you'd like the program to process

### TODO
- Add options for ignoring or including:
  * Blank lines
  * Comments
  * Insignificant lines (brackets etc.)
  * Matching a given pattern(s)
- Add selective counting for code spanning multiple lines (does a broken up class definition count as 1 or many lines?)
- Add redo button
- Add ability to save results to file (.txt, .csv, etc)
- Add ability to ignore files by:
  * Directory
  * File name
- Better formatting in the status output
